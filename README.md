# Stuff Vision
## Machine Learning/Computer Vision demo app

This android app uses a version of the Inception V3 network retrained to recognize the
Caltech 256 image dataset.

This repo contains a simplified and trimmed down version of tensorflow's
[android image classification example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android)
in the `android/` directory.
